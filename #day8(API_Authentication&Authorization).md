Know the difference between authentication and authorization.

     Authentication – Confirms who you are (e.g., username & password). It is a process of verifying user's identity. 
   
     Authorization – Defines what you can access (e.g., a user can view data but not edit it). It determines the what access users have.

Remember that you can be authenticated but not authorized to perform certain actions.

Both are crucial for API security, and here are 5 simple tips to implement them effectively:

1) **Use strong authentication methods** – Prefer OAuth 2.0, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), or API keys over basic authentication (username & password).

2) **Follow the principle of least privilege** – Grant only the minimum access needed for users, reducing security risks.

3) **Implement token expiry and refresh mechanisms** – Ensure access tokens expire after a set time and provide refresh tokens for seamless re-authentication.

4) **Use HTTPS and encrypt sensitive data** – Always secure API communication with HTTPS and encrypt tokens to prevent unauthorized access.

5) **Monitor and log API Access** – Keep track of API usage with logs and alerts to detect unusual activity or potential breaches.
