When sending API requests, few points to keep in mind and consult API documentation for details. 

1) **API endpoint URL** - Ensure the correct URL and API version has been provided.
2) **HTTP method** - Choose correct HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) based on the action going to perform.
3) **Request body** - Ensure body in the correct form such as JSON, form-data. This section contains the data when using the methods such as POST, PUT, PATCH.
4) **Authentication** - Most APIs use authentication for security purpose. It may be API key, OAuth token and other type of authentication. Ensure the API key/token is securely stored and included in the request headers.
5) **Headers** - Include necessary headers such as Content-Type, Authorization, Accept, Content-Length, UserAgent. Pay attention to formats such as JSON or XML.
6) **Rate limits** - APIs may have limitations. Know the limit and avoid exceeding limits. It may result to block requests.
7) **Security considerations** - Keep API keys/Tokens safe and secure in private. Never ever expose to public repositories.
