Understand what type of API protocol used in the system.

When working with APIs, knowing the type of API protocol supports is important for building efficient and scalable systems. 

Here are some of the most commonly used API protocol types:
1) **REST** - Uses HTTP (Application layer protocol) that are sent as human readable texts to access resources through dedicated endpoints. Ideal for web based applications.
2) **GraphQL** - Developed by Facebook in 2015. A query language (not a protocol) that allows clients to request specific data from a single endpoint using HTTP POST requests. No over-fetching or under-fetching.
3) **gRPC** -  Uses HTTP/2 for high-performance communication between microservices with structured data using Protocol Buffers (Protobuf).
4) **SOAP** (Simple Object access protocol) - Due to its security features and built-in error handling, it is mostly used in regulatory industries like finance and healthcare.
5) **WebSocket** - Enables bidirectional real time communication between client and server. Mostly used in chat applications, live notifications and gaming applications.
6) **MQTT** (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) - Lightweight messaging protocol used for Internet of Things (IoT)
