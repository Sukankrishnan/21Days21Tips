The basic knowledge to test API is knowing their endpoints first. 

APIs are structured around major endpoints such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.

If we take [RestfulBooker](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/apidoc/index.html) as an example

https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com**/booking** - **Booking** is the endpoint that returns the list of IDs available.

https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/booking**/:id** - Here **:id** is the endpoint that returns the details of the mentioned ID.
