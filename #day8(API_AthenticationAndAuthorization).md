API Authentication vs. Authorization – Know the Difference!
Authentication – Confirms who you are (e.g., logging in with a username & password).
Authorization – Defines what you can access (e.g., a user can view data but not edit it).

Remember that you can be authenticated but not authorized to perform certain actions.

Both are crucial for API security, and here are 5 simple tips to implement them effectively:

1) Use strong suthentication methods – Prefer OAuth 2.0, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), or API keys over basic authentication (username & password).

2) Follow the principle of least privilege – Grant only the minimum access needed for users, reducing security risks.

3) Implement token expiry and refresh mechanisms – Ensure access tokens expire after a set time and provide refresh tokens for seamless re-authentication.

4) Use HTTPS and encrypt sensitive data – Always secure API communication with HTTPS and encrypt tokens to prevent unauthorized access.

5) Monitor and log API Access – Keep track of API usage with logs and alerts to detect unusual activity or potential breaches.
