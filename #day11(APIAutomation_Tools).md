Don't rely on single tool when someone gives suggestion for API automation tools.

Many more tools available in the market. Explore and use which is feasible to you and your work. I mention some of the commonly used tools.

  1. **Postman + Newman** - Most commonly used open source tool with CLI support. 

  2. **RestAssured** - Java based tool for complex API testing.

  3. **SoapUI (by SmartBear)** - Desktop tool to test SOAP and REST APIs.

  4. **Cypress** - Works well for modern web applications and it is a type of JavaScript test framework.

  5. **Pytest** - Framework for Python lovers. Easy integration with CI/CD tools.
