API testing can be automated to an extent. It will help to reduce the task redundancy manually and get more time to focus on other tasks.

Some of the points to consider in effective API automation
    Don't just focus on API works with valid data. Include invalid input, missing parameters, unauthorized access.
    Create test data and store in external files such as JSON, CSV formats.
    Assert more than just status code. For example: Response body values, headers, data types.
    Keep up to date with the API version to avoid breaking.
    Integrate with CI tools. Many available in teh market such as Jenskins, GitHub Actions.
    Setup notifications via email communication for test failures.
    Store sensitive data like API keys/Tokens as environment variables or in secret management tools.
    Maintain the scripts and refactor regularly to avoid duplicate logic, remove deprecated endpoints.
