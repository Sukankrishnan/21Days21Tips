To test the web API, one must know the importance of understanding network panel in DevTools.

I am giving an example on how to test API in Network tab.

1) Open DevTools (F12 or Right Click > Inspect) and head to the Network tab.

2) Reload the page to capture all network requests, including API calls.

3) Filter by XHR or Fetch to view just the API requests.

4) Click on a request to inspect Request Headers, Payload, and Query Params.

5) Check the Response tab to view the actual API response body.

6) Use the Preview tab for a formatted, readable view of the response.

7) Use Preserve Log to track requests during navigation or refresh.
